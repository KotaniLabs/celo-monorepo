## [Decentralized Impact Incubator](https://blockchainforsocialimpact.com/incubator-winners-2020/) Winners

### Multiply.Charity by Abundance

[Multiply](https://multiply.charity/) the impact of charitable donations by providing liquidity in credit tokens where the legacy financial system fails. Compared to cash donations, like GiveDirectly, this process has two major advantages: The credit tokens 1) fill a demand for liquidity (which banks fail to deliver), thus increasing the incentive to produce goods and services and 2) stay in the local economy longer, resulting in a larger impact (or lower cost overhead) per donation. Early field tests demonstrate up to 20x impact over traditional donations and double the velocity (the rate at which the money is traded) to the US Dollar.

## [Celo Camp](https://www.celocamp.com/) Projects

### Wallet as a Service

Tangany's custody solution [Wallet as a Service](https://docs.tangany.com/?version=latest) enables you to create and 
manage HSM-secured wallets and interact with the underlying blockchain. Our API makes it incredibly easy for developers 
to execute transactions, check details of past transactions or query account balances without any worries about private 
key safekeeping. For the Celo Camp 2020 we have developed a prototype version of our product that integrates the Celo blockchain. 
The [demo project](https://github.com/adrianmitter/celo-camp) presents the new features and provides some code snippets to get started. 

### Celo Toolkit by MugglePay

[MugglePay](https://mugglepay.com/) provides a payment SDK for merchants to accept cryptocurrencies. Mugglepay makes crypto payment easy and thousands of merchants are onboarded with MugglePay SDK. For the Celo Camp 2020, we will integrate with cUSD/cGLD for payments on Celo blockchain.
